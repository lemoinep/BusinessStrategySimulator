# Business Strategy Simulator – Sun Tzu Tactics for Modern Competition

**Business Strategy Simulator** is an interactive application that models and analyzes the strategic and financial competition between two companies. 
Inspired by the principles of Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War,” the simulator helps users experiment with offensive and defensive business tactics, resource allocation, 
AI-driven competitor behaviors, and market adaptations in a realistic, turn-based environment.


## Key Features

- **Company Asset Modeling:** Each company consists of various business units (Sales, Marketing, R&D, Legal, Finance, Analytics, Market Intelligence), each with budgets and distinct competitive strengths.
- **Adaptive AI Competitor:** The program includes an advanced competitor AI that analyzes outcomes and adapts its personality and investment strategy (aggressive, defensive, or deceptive) based on recent performance.
- **Dynamic Environment:** The simulation considers shifting market types (stable, volatile, regulated, etc.), economic conditions (growth, inflation, recession), and business cycles (quarters).
- **Strategic Actions and Events:** Users encounter realistic business scenarios such as surprise product launches, supply chain disruption, market campaigns, regulatory impacts, and more.
- **Resource Management:** Allocate cash, investment points, and brand strength strategically across business units to maximize performance and respond to environmental changes.
- **Turn-Based Simulation:** Play through multiple quarters, with each turn representing a period (e.g., one fiscal quarter) in which companies act, invest, compete, and adapt.
- **Data Visualization:** Track and analyze key indicators (market share, stress, liquidity, sentiment, strategic actions) with interactive charts.
- **Result Reporting:** Automatically generates comprehensive Excel reports summarizing the campaign, assets, actions, and outcomes for both companies.
- **Save/Load Functionality:** Save campaign progress to resume or analyze scenarios later.

## How It Works ?

Each simulation round represents a business quarter. You, as the primary company, allocate resources to business units, choose investment strategies, and influence market outcomes. 
The AI competitor continually adapts its strategy, observing your moves and responding aggressively, defensively, or with deception. 
The simulation resolves market competition, strategic attacks (like marketing campaigns or sabotage), and defensive measures, all while factoring in environmental changes and company morale.

Throughout each turn, key metrics (such as market share, sentiment, stress, liquidity) are updated and visualized. Ultimately, the program determines the winner by comparing 
the final market share held by each company.

## Use Cases

- **Educational tool:** Explore practical applications of competitive strategy, resource management, and adaptive AI in business.
- **Scenario analysis:** Test “what-if” outcomes for business decisions, market disruptions, and competitive tactics.
- **Strategic planning:** Simulate campaigns for startups, established companies, or hypothetical sectors.
